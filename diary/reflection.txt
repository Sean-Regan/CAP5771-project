Starting with the data visualization done during the Data Exploration phase, there already seems to be a decent basis to
compare the prices across the two grocery stores. The only limitation on this would be that we have yet to run the Whole
Foods scraper for a longer period of time (accidentally overwrote it once whoops) so the current scraped dataset is 
somewhat small, especially compared to the larger Walmart dataset. 

As for further steps, comparisons with regards to nutrients will need to be done in regards to specific products, with a
lexical similarity algorithm of some sort matching the product name and brand in the price datasets to the nutritional
information in the usda nutrient datasets. From there, we will standardize the amount of nutrients based on the price,
allowing direct comparison between brands, stores, and locations
