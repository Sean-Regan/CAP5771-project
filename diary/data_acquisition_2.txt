We began designing the database around the usda 'branded food' nutrient datasets, which contained product names, brand info,
and nutrient amounts. Product descriptions, brand info, gtin/upc numbers, and serving sizes were put together into a 'food'
table. Nutrient information were stored in a seperate 'food_nutrient' table with an entry for each different nutrient of each
food item in the food table. An fdc_id is used across all nutrient tables to identify each unique food. Finally, a 'nutrient'
table contains information about the nutrient types and measuring units used in the 'food_nutrient' table.

For pricing information, the kaggle Walmart dataset and the scraped Whole Foods dataset were each made into individual tables:
'walmart_price' and 'wholefoods_price'. Both tables contain product names, prices, zip codes, and brand names, with the Walmart
table containing additional information on categories, subcategories, product sizes, and internal sku numbers.

While the product names across the nutrient table and price tables are not standardized, we plan to use lexical similarity 
between the product names and brand names to pair entries.
