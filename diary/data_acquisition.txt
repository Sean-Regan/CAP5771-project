We began by researching datasets for the nutritional information of food items, quickly finding an official usda nutrition dataset
at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets. The 'branded foods' dataset contains information on the product, brand, brand owner,
nutritional info, and several other useful pieces of information.

Due to the large variety of prices between grocery stores, we needed to find separate datasets for each grocery store we wanted to
include in the project. After searching kaggle, we were able to find one for Walmart at 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/product-prices-and-sizes-from-walmart-grocery, but were unable to find datasets for
other grocery chains such as Publix or Whole Foods. Instead, we decided to scrape price and brand information from the Whole Foods
website using the 'whole-foods-scraper.py' script we created.

While we could similarly scrape information from other grocery chains, we decided to focus on Walmart and Whole Foods (at least for
the start of the project) as they represent both a low-cost store and high-cost store. If time allows, including data sets for Publix,
Aldi's, or Trader Joe's would allow for a greater range of comparison between individual products and the chains as a whole.
