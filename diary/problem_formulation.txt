Some of our first ideas for the project were focused on media recommendations or language study. We ended up
discarding several of these due to wanting something more impactful and relevant to someone's everyday life.
We came upon the idea of nutrition while brainstorming and developed it further as it was simple yet highly 
relevant, especially due to rising grocery prices in recent times. Additionally, one of the group member's
girlfriend is a food science minor and is quite knowledgeable on the subject nutrition.

While directly comparing nutritional value to price point seemed potentially too simple at first, we found several 
other means of comparison that allowed us to increase the scope of the project. These included geographical location,
food type, grocery chain, type of nutrient, brand, and other additional info provided in the datasets. Our output
will be displayed as a comparison between the nutrient to price ratio (for each individual nutrient) of different
brands of food across a singular type of food item. For example, comparing Whole Foods brand granola bars and
Great Value brand granola bars, with additionaly comparisons available between different zip codes and other
relevant metrics.
